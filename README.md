# Healthpath PRO - Food catalog

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Healthpath PRO food catalog page using the [Mock API](https://62da64419eedb699636cf77d.mockapi.io/api/v1/foods) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Sample response from food API as a food object.
```json
{
  "createdAt": "2022-08-04T22:46:50.816Z",
  "name": "Elegant Steel Sausages",
  "description": "New range of formal shirts are designed keeping you in mind. With fits and styling that will make you stand apart",
  "tags": "normal, vegan, pescatarian",
  "id": "1"
}
```

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. 

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Load food catalog from API (no paging required)
- Perform basic on page search by title without interacting with API
- Navigate through tabs (keep rest of the tabs empty)

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
